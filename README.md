-- Hello, this is Adam from Atom Lab X 👨🏾‍💻

Project Overview:
* This is the second VER of the Anime WallPapreApp.
* I used to work on that app, before I knew what GitHub is, so the first commit contains so much data, (it could have been so many green dots, but OH WELL... 😩)
* It is a passion project, And I'm doing that for fun!

Contribution Guidelines:
* Feedback is welcome (to improve the app).
* No Forking Allowed.

C Ya on the other side! 👋🏾
