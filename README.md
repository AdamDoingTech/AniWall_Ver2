-- Hello, this is Adam from Atom Lab X 👨🏾‍💻

Project Overview:
* 2nd Ver of Anime Wall Paper App.
* I worked on the App for a bit before adding it to github, so the initial commit (Have many line of code). 
* It is a fun project (I learn as I go)
* Why Ver 2? - Because that is the second edition of the App, the first edition never came outside of my local machine, I might add it here someday, so others can learn from my past mistakes with it!, but overall, I started all over again and here I'm.

Contribution Guidelines:
* Feedback is welcome (To improve the App).
* No Forking Allowed In The Meantime.

C Ya on the other side! 👋🏾
